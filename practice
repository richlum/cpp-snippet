this is my practice session
i keep having long pauses as i struggle to recall 
interestingly, i think i keep stalling when i automatically recall
the qwerty keyboard instead of the dvorak keyboard

I also find myself wrongly typing d instead of e on the qwerty sessions
this is happening with increasing frequency

interestingly, it seems to work best when i can clear my mind and
relax instead of trying to push and actively recall, but there are
long periods of staring with no movement

i can feel something like a bouncing or back and forth
sometimes blanking works better
sometimes active thoughts seem better
grouping of frequent pairs and triplets helps

there is a very stilted feeling instead of the desired flow
