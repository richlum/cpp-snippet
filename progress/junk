Today is Wednesday August 23.   My name is Richard Lum and I am trying to 
learn how to use the dvorak keyboard.  In some ways, I am pleased that
my mind can still adapt.  In other ways, it feels painfully slow.

While I keep making lots of mistakes and have a very broken rythmn,
I do seem to be able to find the keys without looking at a keymap. 
It's wierd because it feels left brain right brain handoff taking 
place as I stare and wait for my fingers to move and occassionally
verbalizing some clue or reference point.   Can't but help feel 
like their is some reconciling going on as I work out qwerty vs 
dvorak, main row vs up or down, right or left hand. So many conflicts
and yet it seems to work best when I try to quiet the mind.
